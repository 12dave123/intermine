<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
	This document is an attempt to create a consistent specification of the Flymine query, specifically its graphical representation.

<title>Initial description</title>

<para>
	Our database stores separate collections of data, where each collection stores data all of the same type.
	<graphic fileref="Gene" format="PNG" align="Left" />
	These collections can be compared to tables in SQL or object classes in an Object Oriented DB.
	A query will retrieve data from one or more of these collections - so the graphical representation of a query consists of an arrangement of objects on the screen, each of which represent one of these collections.
	The figure on the left is an example of such an object, which represents the collection of Genes in the database.
	The object type "Gene" is represented as a box, with a title at the top declaring its type, and a list of fields in the object below it.
<!--	(Note that these aren't necessarily the fields of a Gene object - it is just an example picture.) -->
	<graphic fileref="Gene2" format="PNG" align="Right" />
	The picture shown on the right is a complete query - it represents "List all genes" - a relatively simple query.
</para>

<para>
	The query shown on the right is similar - it represents the query "List all genes, where the gene field 'A Field' equals 'Hello'."
	In this way, restrictions can be placed on the fields, like the <emphasis>where</emphasis> clause in SQL or OQL.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>Joining multiple object types</title>

<para>
	The query on the left shows two object types in a query, joined together with a line between Gene.Sequences and Sequence.Genes.
	<graphic fileref="GeneSequenceR" format="PNG" align="Left" />
	Formally, the query results contain every possible combination of each Gene with each Sequence, where the restriction represented by the line (Gene contains Sequence) is true.
</para>

<para>
	<graphic fileref="GeneSequence" format="PNG" align="Right" />
	For completeness, the query on the right is also valid - it represents "List all possible combinations of every Gene with every Sequence."
	It is not normally useful to produce a query like this.
