<title>Contributing code to the FlyMine project</title>

<para>We warmly welcome contributions to the project, however big or
small. If you would like to get involved, the best thing to do is talk
to existing developers via the flymine-dev mailing list, to prevent
unnecessary duplication of work.</para>

<para>We prefer to accept patches against the current CVS
repository. All code must adhere to the <ulink
url="coding-standards">FlyMine coding standards</ulink> (note
specifically that every metod of every class must have comprehensive
unit tests), and not cause any existing unit tests to fail.</para>
