<para>The FlyMine project is building an integrated database of
genomic, expression and protein data for
<firstterm>Drosophila</firstterm> and <firstterm>Anopheles</firstterm>
and making this available to the worldwide research community via web
and bioinformatics interfaces. The FlyMine project is based at the
<ulink url="http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk">Department of Genetics</ulink>,
<ulink url="http://www.cam.ac.uk">University of Cambridge</ulink> and
is a collaboration between the Genetics and <ulink
url="http://www.bioc.cam.ac.uk">Biochemistry</ulink> departments of
the University of Cambridge.</para>

<title>Aims</title>

The main aims of the project are
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>To create a database for the management of Drosophila and
Anopheles data generated by existing high-throughput post-genomics
techniques: expression studies, proteomics and 3D protein structure
prediction.</listitem>

<listitem>To integrate the above database with the curated database of
Drosophila genetics (FlyBase), the annotated view of the Drosophila
genome (GadFly) and corresponding Anopheles data.</listitem>

<listitem>To enable the database to be queried via the Internet in
order to facilitate the widest possible use by the broader
community.</listitem>

<listitem>To support bulk access to the data for those studying the
entire dataset and for those generating new analysis
algorithms.</listitem>

<listitem>To provide information that will allow other resources to
link to the contents of the database.</listitem>

<listitem>To make the database schema and associated programs freely
available to the community using an open source CVS
repository. Likewise to work collaboratively to generate and promote
the use of public data exchange standards.</listitem>

<listitem>To provide analysis support to facilitate use of the
database and data by the community.</listitem>
