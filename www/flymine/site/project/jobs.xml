<title>Computer Officer Grade II (Software Development)</title>

<para>Salary: £29,478 - £31,175</para>
<para>Limit of tenure: 30 September 2006 *</para>

<para>We are looking for a software developer, ideally with experience
in a biological field to join a small team working on a project that
seeks to integrate functional genomics data from the model organisms
Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae, using data generated by
high throughput laboratory activity in the department and
worldwide. This Cambridge-MIT Institute funded post will extend the
above project to cover human genetic data generated by groups at the
Cambridge Institute for Medical Research. Proposed start date: June
2004.</para>

<para>We are building a web application and associated infrastructure
that will enable researchers to perform complex queries over a wide
range of genomic and proteomic data sources, containing many terabytes
of data between them. We are using Java and XML with a PostgreSQL
backend, in a Linux/Unix environment, and making use of existing open
source tools and libraries where possible. All our code is freely
available under an open source licence. As a team, the software
developers are responsible for gathering requirements, designing,
coding and testing the system, many parts of which are technically
challenging. Further details of the project can be found at <ulink
url="http://www.flymine.org"/>.</para>

<para>You will be heavily involved with the data, data model and
dataflow aspects of the system. Ideally you should have a background
in the biological sciences and be familiar with biological data
sources and the modelling and analysis of biological data, including
the use of ontologies. You should also have at least one year's
experience of software development in Java and any experience in using
XML or SQL/OQL would be an advantage.</para>

<para>* Funds for this post are available until 30 September 2006 in
the first instance, and the post may, subject to availability of
funding, be renewed for a further period or periods.</para>
