InterMine is a generic object data warehouse system developed as part
of the FlyMine project (<ulink url="http://www.flymine.org"/>) and made
available as standalone open-source software.
</para>

<para>
InterMine takes one or more data models in many different formats
(UML, OWL, DAG, XML Schema) as input and, using a user-specified merge
specification written in OWL, produces an integrated target
model. This in turn is used to automatically generate a complete
system for efficiently integrating, storing and querying objects
originating from many different sources. InterMine has its own query
language (similar to OQL) which can be used from within a Java
program, within the InterMine shell, or is produced by the web front
end.
</para>

<para>
The software has been optimised to deal easily with multi-gigabyte
data sources. It will, optionally, track the source of each piece of
data and assign priorities to each data source to reflect the
reliability of the data originating from it. The data are stored
highly redundantly, with the InterMine query optimiser module
automatically analysing incoming queries to try and make use, in full
or part, of precomputed results in order to improve response times for
users. In-built caching and paging of results further reduce load on
the underlying relational database.
</para>

<para>
InterMine comes with a customisable web front end containing an HTML
query building tool and results display, and a webservice for
accessing the data across the internet. The website can easily be
customised to interface to external programs and web pages, and to
provide a range of example queries to help new end-users.
